# Parksy

Welcome to Parksy, a web application to help travelers plan trips to visit US National Parks with ease. Parksy is a practice project I am building to gain more experience with React, MySQL, and other frameworks and libraries. I welcome any questions, comments, for feedback/suggestions, and please check back as development progresses!
